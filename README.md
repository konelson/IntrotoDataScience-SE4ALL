Intro to Data Science - Sustainable Energy for All, The World Bank

Predicting Renewable Energy Consumption Over Time:

i.  By how much will global energy efficiency increase over the next 5 years?

ii. SE4ALL database, IEA and World Bank (https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/sustainable-energy-for-all)

iii. This dataset has 2849 rows including countries and clean energy indicators with 30 columns covering years dating back to 1990.  I will need to clean the data to remove all null values and reorganize the countries along the header.

iv.  I am interested in learning about renewable energy options, its current and future utilization patterns, as well as understanding how sustainable energy will impact climate change.
